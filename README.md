# IDS-for-Avionics-Networks
This Intrusion Detection System (IDS) monitors avionics communication networks like MIL-STD-1553 and CAN bus to detect anomalies and cyberattacks. Using machine learning, it identifies suspicious patterns such as spoofing and flooding, enhancing avionics network security for safer flight operations.
